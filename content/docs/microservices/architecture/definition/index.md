## Microservices Architecture Definition

- small services in a computing architecture
- breaking the monolith; decomposing) a single, large program into pieces
- microservice architecture consists of services (we call it "service"; not "microservice")
- all components (services) behave as a single application, we call it "microservices architecture"
